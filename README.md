I follow the below steps to run the core System of the food text classification system on input from user .

1. Download npm: sudo apt install npm
2. Create and open project folder: mkdir [workshop2]
3. Initialize requirements: npm init -y 
4. Add index.html,index.js and train.txt in the same folder. 
5. Install the Node.js sandbox for the Machine learning algorithm (fasttext): npm install nodefasttext --save
6. Install Express: npm install express --save
7. Install some cors issues: npm install cors --save
8. Now if you want to get this sandbox up and running pretty quick you go ahead and use my
